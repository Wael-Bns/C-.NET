This is a learning project with C# and aspdotnet core </br>
It is a Web page to display dishes like pizza ...</br>
Design : MVC (Model-View-Controller)</br>
Database : mysql,</br>
Data added manually ,</br>
I used EF Core to do database migrations and communicate with the database.</br>
The controller is responsible for handling Http requests, there is no API Controller.
